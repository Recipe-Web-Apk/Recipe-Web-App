# Regression-Based Recommendation System

## Overview

This system implements a dynamic, user behavior-based recommendation algorithm using linear regression to personalize recipe recommendations based on user interactions. The system focuses on the core parameters you specified: **relevance**, **cuisine type**, **popularity**, and **season**, with nutritional data as additional parameters.

**Focus**: The system prioritizes **liked** and **saved** recipes as the primary signals for personalization, as these represent the strongest user preferences.

## Key Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Core Parameters (Primary Focus)
- **Relevance**: Based on user preferences and interaction history
- **Cuisine Type**: Normalized cuisine match with user preferences
- **Popularity**: Global recipe popularity based on interactions
- **Season**: Seasonal relevance and timing

### ðŸ¥— Additional Nutritional Parameters
- **Calories**: Normalized calorie content (0-2000 range)
- **Protein**: Normalized protein content (0-100g range)
- **Fat**: Normalized fat content (0-100g range)
- **Carbohydrates**: Normalized carb content (0-300g range)
- **Fiber**: Normalized fiber content (0-50g range)
- **Sugar**: Normalized sugar content (0-100g range)

## Architecture

### Database Schema

#### 1. `user_interactions` Table
Tracks all user interactions with recipes for training data:
```sql
- user_id: UUID (references users.id)
- recipe_id: UUID (references recipes.id)
- spoonacular_id: INTEGER (for external recipes)
- interaction_type: TEXT ('view', 'like', 'save')
- interaction_value: NUMERIC (1, 2, 3 respectively)
- recipe_features: JSONB (stored feature vector)
- created_at: TIMESTAMP
```

#### 2. `user_feature_weights` Table
Stores personalized regression coefficients per user:
```sql
- user_id: UUID (references users.id)
- interaction_type: TEXT ('view', 'like', 'save')
- feature_name: TEXT (feature name)
- weight: NUMERIC (regression coefficient)
- last_updated: TIMESTAMP
```

#### 3. `recipe_features` Table
Caches pre-computed feature vectors for performance:
```sql
- recipe_id: UUID (references recipes.id)
- spoonacular_id: INTEGER
- feature_vector: JSONB (normalized feature vector)
- popularity_score: NUMERIC
- relevance_score: NUMERIC
- last_updated: TIMESTAMP
```

#### 4. `regression_metrics` Table
Stores model performance metrics for A/B testing:
```sql
- user_id: UUID (references users.id)
- model_version: TEXT ('v1', 'v2', etc.)
- interaction_type: TEXT
- mse: NUMERIC (mean squared error)
- r_squared: NUMERIC (R-squared value)
- feature_importance: JSONB
- training_samples: INTEGER
- last_trained: TIMESTAMP
```

## How It Works

### 1. Feature Extraction
For each recipe, the system extracts and normalizes features:

```javascript
const features = {
  relevance: calculateRelevanceScore(recipe, userPreferences),
  cuisine_type: calculateCuisineMatch(recipe, userPreferences),
  popularity: calculatePopularityScore(recipe),
  season: calculateSeasonalScore(recipe),
  calories: normalizeCalories(nutrition.calories),
  protein: normalizeProtein(nutrition.protein),
  // ... other features
};
```

### 2. Interaction Tracking
When users interact with recipes, the system tracks:
- **View**: Value = 1 (lowest engagement)
- **Like**: Value = 2 (moderate engagement - primary signal)
- **Save**: Value = 3 (highest engagement - primary signal)

### 3. Regression Training
For each interaction type, the system trains separate regression models:

```javascript
// Training data preparation
const X = interactions.map(interaction => Object.values(interaction.recipe_features));
const y = interactions.map(interaction => interaction.interaction_value);

// Linear regression using normal equation
const weights = performLinearRegression(X, y);
```

### 4. Recommendation Scoring
Recipes are scored using the trained weights, with focus on like and save:

```javascript
const likeScore = features.relevance * likeWeights.relevance +
                  features.cuisine_type * likeWeights.cuisine_type +
                  // ... other features

const saveScore = features.relevance * saveWeights.relevance +
                  features.cuisine_type * saveWeights.cuisine_type +
                  // ... other features

const finalScore = (likeScore * 0.6) + (saveScore * 0.4);
```

## API Endpoints

### Main Recommendation Endpoint
```http
GET /recommendations/:userId
```
- **Default**: Uses regression system
- **Fallback**: Add `?regression=false` to use original algorithm

### Interaction Tracking Endpoints
```http
POST /recommendations/track-view/:userId
POST /recommendations/track-like/:userId
POST /recommendations/track-save/:userId
```
Body: `{ "recipeId": "uuid", "spoonacularId": 123 }`

### Analytics Endpoints
```http
GET /recommendations/weights/:userId
GET /recommendations/metrics/:userId
```

## Setup Instructions

### 1. Database Setup
```bash
cd backend/SQL
node setup-regression-tables.js
```

### 2. Test the System
```bash
cd backend/Testing
node test-regression-recommendation.js
```

## Configuration

### Default Feature Weights
The system uses different default weights for each interaction type, with focus on like and save:

| Feature | View | Like | Save |
|---------|------|------|------|
| Relevance | 0.30 | 0.40 | 0.35 |
| Cuisine Type | 0.20 | 0.25 | 0.20 |
| Popularity | 0.20 | 0.15 | 0.15 |
| Season | 0.10 | 0.10 | 0.10 |
| Calories | 0.05 | 0.03 | 0.05 |
| Protein | 0.05 | 0.03 | 0.05 |
| Fat | 0.05 | 0.02 | 0.05 |
| Carbs | 0.05 | 0.02 | 0.05 |

### Final Score Calculation
```javascript
// Weighted combination focusing on like and save
const finalScore = (likeScore * 0.6) + (saveScore * 0.4);
```

### Normalization Ranges
- **Calories**: 0-2000 calories
- **Protein**: 0-100g
- **Fat**: 0-100g
- **Carbohydrates**: 0-300g
- **Fiber**: 0-50g
- **Sugar**: 0-100g
- **Sodium**: 0-2000mg
- **Cook Time**: 0-180 minutes
- **Prep Time**: 0-60 minutes

## Performance Considerations

### Caching
- Recipe feature vectors are cached in `recipe_features` table
- User weights are updated asynchronously after interactions
- Feature extraction is optimized for common recipe formats

### Scalability
- Indexes on frequently queried columns
- Background weight updates to avoid blocking user interactions
- Efficient matrix operations for regression calculations

### Fallback Strategy
- Original algorithm available as fallback
- Default weights for new users
- Graceful degradation if regression fails

## Monitoring and Analytics

### Model Metrics
- **MSE (Mean Squared Error)**: Measures prediction accuracy
- **R-squared**: Measures model fit quality
- **Feature Importance**: Shows which features matter most
- **Training Samples**: Number of interactions used for training

### A/B Testing
- Multiple model versions can be tracked
- Performance comparison between versions
- Gradual rollout capabilities

## Example Usage

### Frontend Integration
```javascript
// Track user interaction (focus on like and save)
await fetch('/api/recommendations/track-like/user123', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
  body: JSON.stringify({ recipeId: 'recipe456' })
});

// Get personalized recommendations
const recommendations = await fetch('/api/recommendations/user123');
const recipes = await recommendations.json();

// Each recipe has regression scores (like and save focus)
recipes.forEach(recipe => {
  console.log(`${recipe.title}:`);
  console.log(`  Like Score: ${recipe.likeScore}`);
  console.log(`  Save Score: ${recipe.saveScore}`);
  console.log(`  Final Score: ${recipe.finalScore}`);
});
```

### Weight Analysis
```javascript
// Get user's feature weights
const weights = await fetch('/api/recommendations/weights/user123');
const userWeights = await weights.json();

// Analyze what matters to this user (focus on like and save)
console.log('Like weights:');
Object.entries(userWeights.like).forEach(([feature, weight]) => {
  console.log(`  ${feature}: ${weight.weight}`);
});

console.log('Save weights:');
Object.entries(userWeights.save).forEach(([feature, weight]) => {
  console.log(`  ${feature}: ${weight.weight}`);
});
```

## Benefits

1. **Personalization**: Each user gets unique feature weights based on their behavior
