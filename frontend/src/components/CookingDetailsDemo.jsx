          <div className="info-item">
            <h4>‚è±Ô∏è Time Calculation</h4>
            <p>The system calculates total time from prep time + cook time, or uses readyInMinutes from Spoonacular API. It also determines time complexity levels based on total cooking time.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="info-item">
            <h4>üéØ Cooking Technique</h4>
            <p>Cooking technique refers to the specific method used: Frying, Poaching, Braising, Saut√©ing, Searing, Steaming, Boiling, Simmering, Roasting, Grilling, Baking, etc. Not all recipes require cooking techniques (e.g., no-bake desserts, fresh salads).</p>
          </div>
          <div className="info-item">
            <h4>üî• Cooking Equipment</h4>
            <p>Cooking equipment specifies the tools needed: Stovetop, Oven, Grill, Slow Cooker, Air Fryer, Pressure Cooker, Smoker, Steamer, Deep Fryer, Wok, Dutch Oven, etc. Some recipes may not require specific cooking equipment.</p>
          </div>
          <div className="info-item">
            <h4>üìä Difficulty Assessment</h4>
            <p>Difficulty is automatically calculated based on total time and complexity. Quick recipes are usually Easy, longer recipes may be Medium or Hard depending on technique.</p>
